# Atrab Project Charter

## Project Objectives

### Problem

Students need a way to communicate and share course resources with each other outside the class effectively, but using traditional social media platforms might be affected scattered resources, messages from unwanted and suspicious ads.

### Objectives

We aspire to achieve these objectives bu the end of this project:

- add the ability for students to make course groups to reduce their time to find course group messages(TFCGM) after 3 months.
- add the ability to rate resources to increase the quality of the resources shown in the beginning of the course resources section after 3 months.
- add the ability to detect and remove spam messages to reduce the number of spam messages in course groups(NSM).

### Solution

Atrab will be a centralized platform where students can create course-specific groups, share verified resources, and collaborate efficiently. The system will implement a resource-rating mechanism to ensure high-quality materials are prioritized. An integrated machine-learning spam-detection module will automatically filter out unwanted or suspicious messages.

## Stakeholders and Roles

Stakeholders:

- Our team
- Students
- Tuwaig Holberton bootcamp mentors

Team Roles:

- Abdulaziz almutairi: Team Lead and Project Manager
- Ismail Rowaihy: Backend Developer
- Farah Almozaini: Frontend Developer
- Sara Ali Mareer: Machine Learning Developer

## Scope

In-Scope:

- course groups for students
- facilitate resource sharing between students
- remove spam messages from course groups
- add the ability to control group access

Out-of-scope:

- Selling items between students
- AI summary for courses

## Risks

- Machine learning spam detection may require additional dataset preparation, which could delay integration.
- Handling user-generated content may raise data security and privacy issues if not properly addressed.
- Finals exams and team schedule constraints may cause unexpected delays.
