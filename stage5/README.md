## Lessons Learned

- For the initial version of the project, a Waterfall approach was more effective than Agile, as it provided clearer requirements and better upfront alignment.
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) proved to be a strong approach for shaping a clean, maintainable software architecture.
- Docker Compose significantly simplified deployment and reduced operational overhead during development.
- Starting development with multiple services and containers added unnecessary complexity; a simpler architecture is more suitable in early stages.
- Prototypes should be treated as disposable artifacts and discarded after customer review and discussion to prevent premature design lock-in.
